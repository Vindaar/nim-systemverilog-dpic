This directory contains all the C examples from the above reference
translated to Nim.

This directory demonstrates how equivalent Nim code can be written to
do the exact same interfacing with SystemVerilog via DPI-C.

While translating the examples, few fixes in them were also made to
ensure that those examples actually run.
