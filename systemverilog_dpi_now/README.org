#+title: SystemVerilog DPI Now

The examples in the [[examples_orig/][*examples_orig* directory]] are authored by Rich
Edelman and I take no ownership of those.

In the other sub-directories in this directory, I (Kaushal Modi) have
translated the C code from the ~examples_orig/~ directory to Nim to
demonstrate how it can be interfaced with SystemVerilog via DPI-C.

Those examples are associated with his DVCon 2005 paper and
presentation "Using SystemVerilog Now with DPI". The PDF of those were
provided by Rich Edelman and they can be found [[_paper_and_presentation][here]].
